Er, sorry, there isn't an install procedure yet.

However, it's simple to run BBChop from the source tree. You need:

 - a version of python (I have 2.5.2, versions close to that should work)
 - mpmath 
          http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/, 
	  packaged as python-mpmath in debian based distros
	  (bundled with sympy in fedora?)

  [Actually any arbitrary precision library should work, but when I last looked
  only mpmath came with a fractional power function.]

Once the prerequisites are installed, you can run bbchop. You need to set PYTHONPATH to point at
the source dir, eg:

PYTHONPATH=/path/to/BBChop/source bbchop
