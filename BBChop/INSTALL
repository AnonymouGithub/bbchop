Er, sorry, there isn't an install procedure yet.

However, it's simple to run BBChop from the source tree. You need:

 - a version of python (I have 2.6.2, versions close to that should work)
 - mpmath (optional, but 10x faster than python's built in decimal module)
          http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/, 
	  packaged as python-mpmath in debian based distros
	  (bundled with sympy in fedora?)



Once the prerequisites are installed, you can run bbchop. 
You need to set PYTHONPATH to point at
the source dir, eg:

PYTHONPATH=/path/to/BBChop/source bbchop
